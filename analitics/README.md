# Types of Data Analysis

Analysis of data is a vital part of running a successful business. When data is used effectively,
it leads to better understanding of a business’s previous performance and better decision-making
for its future activities. There are many ways that data can be utilized, at all levels of a company’s operations.

There are four types of data analysis that are in use across all industries.
While we separate these into categories, they are all linked together and build upon each other.
As you begin moving from the simplest type of analytics to more complex,
the degree of difficulty and resources required increases. At the same time,
the level of added insight and value also increases.

- Descriptive Analysis
